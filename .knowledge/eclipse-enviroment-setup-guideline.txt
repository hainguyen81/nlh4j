1.	Install eclipse
2.	Modify eclipse.ini flowing the instruction in [eclipse-4.24-lombok-1.18.30-configuration.txt]
3.	Use git to clone source
4.	Use batch script from [.batches] to setup eclipse enviroment and build source (suggestion - should executing batch scripts under administration right):
	- Check/Modify the enviroment variables compatibility with local in [setenv.bat]
	- Run [resolve.bat] for resolving/downloading dependencies/plugins to local maven repository
	- Run [eclipseSetup.bat] for generating eclipse project files such as .project, .classpath, .settings, .factorypath, etc.
5.	Open eclipse and import source as existing maven project
6.	After importing, we will have some projects error on building:
	- Check their build paths whether were included the [src/main/java], [src/main/resources], [src/test/java], [src/test/resources] folder as source folders
	- If not yet, then adding them manually for these error projects
	- Update maven project or re-building all projects by eclipse clean feature

Important: Need to do these steps for nlh4j first, after that is for other projects, due to nlh4j is base FW for other projects.
We need to build it first to install dependencies for local maven repository.
